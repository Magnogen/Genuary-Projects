### 1st
```
Draw 10,000 of something. (credit: Michael Lowe)
```
~~Well I guess I'd better get started then! 10,000 will surely take a while!~~

It sure did - almost 2 hours of simulating and tweaking parameters later and I came up with this!

### 2nd
```
Dithering. (credit: Anna Lucia)
```
~~I've never delt with Dithering before, I wonder how I could do this...~~

That was fun! I think I might use dithering in future projects - it's surprisingly simple anyways
